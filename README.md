## Leonardo Bishop (*he/him*) ðŸ‘‹

### Hello! ðŸŽ‰

I'm **Leonardo**, a hobbyist programmer based in the United Kingdom.

I'm currently completing a degree in Computer Science at university, 
and I like to spend some of free time working on projects like
[Quests](https://github.com/LMBishop/Quests),
or learning new tools and languages.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to be very active during term-time, so if you are
wondering why I have not responded to your issue then that is the reason.
This, combined with general burn-out, means that issues may go uninvestigated,
questions may not be responded to, and features or bug-fuxes may not be
added for some time.

### Contact ðŸ“©

If you need to contact me privately, my email address is 
**`me [at] leonardobishop [dot] com`**.
