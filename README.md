## Leonardo Bishop (*he/him*) ðŸ‘‹
### Hello! ðŸŽ‰  
I'm **Leonardo Bishop**, a British programmer studying Computer Science full-time at university. My public work visible here on GitHub is mostly my *Minecraft*-related work.

### Current circumstances
Being a student means I do not have very much time. If you are using an open-source project which I maintain and are not happy with the feature-set, length of time between updates, support etc. then my best advice to you is to *look for another suitable different project*.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to be very active during term-time, and watching the issue tracker pile-up as a lone maintainer is daunting. That, combined with general burn-out, means that issues may go uninvestigated, support requests may not be responded to, and features and bug-fixes may not be pushed for some time. I ask that if you do use one of my projects that you remain patient and to not harass me on Discord (or any other social media).

If you are absolutely desperate, you can send an email to &lt;contact (at) leonardobishop.com&gt;, however I **absolutely cannot guarantee a response**. I am only one person and cannot respond to every single support request; it is likely that your answer can be found within the documentation if you can take the time to read it.

Thank you. ðŸ˜Š

Most of my work here on GitHub has something to do with *Minecraft*. I've also written a few Discord bots, maintain a Reddit bot, and dabble with full-stack (web) development, working primarily with NodeJS on the server side. When I'm not too busy with uni work, I'm also learning Kotlin.

#### *Minecraft*-related
* [Quests](https://github.com/LMBishop/Quests) - likely my most popular work. This project is probably the reason why you are viewing this page (unless you're stalking me), and I have learned a lot maintaining this project. Admittedly, there is still a lot to do with it and a lot I want to refactor, but simply do not have the time to.
* [Other projects](https://github.com/LMBishop?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=java&sort=) - my other *Minecraft* projects, though not nearly as popular as Quests.

#### Personal projects
* [u/YTLinkerBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/ytlinkerbot) - reddit bot which crossposts YouTube links to reddit. This bot was originally written in Java but is in dire need of a redesign (which I have been intermittently working on and off). It constantly hits the YouTube Data API quota, and my recode instead relies on the WebSub protocol, so I don't have to constantly poll YouTube.
* [Next Bus](https://leonardobishop.com/nextbus/) - simple service which returns live bus data based on open telemetry. This was one of my first web projects and admittedly the front-end is terrible, though it was never designed to look pretty or for anyone but myself to use. It solved a very simple issue I had back in 2018: which was that my nearest bus stop lacked a departure board. This project allowed me to both learn the basics of how the web works and to also not keep missing my buses for Sixth Form.
* Discord bots - some written in Java using JDA, some in JS using discord.js.
