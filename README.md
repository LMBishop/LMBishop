## Leonardo Bishop (*he/him*) ðŸ‘‹
### Hello! ðŸŽ‰  
I'm **Leonardo Bishop**, a British programmer studying Computer Science full-time at the University of Birmingham. My public work visible here on GitHub is my *Minecraft*-related work.

### Current circumstances
Being a student means I do not have very much time. If you are using an open-source project which I maintain and are not happy with the feature-set, length of time between updates, support etc. then my best advice to you is to *look for another suitable different project*.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to be very active during term-time, and watching the issue tracker pile-up as a lone maintainer is daunting. That, combined with general burn-out, means that issues may go uninvestigated, support requests may not be responded to, and features and bug-fixes may not be pushed for some time. I ask that if you do use one of my projects that you remain patient and to not harass me on Discord (or any other social media).

Thank you. ðŸ˜Š

### Projects

<summary>Projects (click to open)</summary>

Most of my work here on GitHub has something to do with *Minecraft*. Privately, I've written a few Discord bots, maintain a Reddit bot, and dabble with full-stack (web) development, working primarily with NodeJS on the server side.

#### *Minecraft*-related
* [Quests](https://github.com/LMBishop/Quests) - likely my most popular work. This project is probably the reason why you are viewing this page (unless you're stalking me), and I have learned a lot maintaining this project. Admittedly, there is still a lot to do with it and a lot I want to refactor, but simply do not have the time to.
* [Other projects](https://github.com/LMBishop?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=java&sort=) - my other *Minecraft* projects, though not nearly as popular as Quests.

#### Personal projects
* [u/YTLinkerBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/ytlinkerbot) - reddit bot which crossposts YouTube links to reddit. This bot was originally written in Java but is in dire need of a redesign (which I have been intermittently working on and off). It constantly hits the YouTube Data API quota, and my recode instead relies on the WebSub protocol, so I don't have to constantly poll YouTube.
* [Next Bus](https://leonardobishop.com/nextbus/) - simple service which returns live bus data based on open telemetry. This was one of my first web projects and admittedly the front-end is terrible, though it was never designed to look pretty or for anyone but myself to use. It solved a very simple issue I had back in 2018: which was that my nearest bus stop lacked a departure board. This project allowed me to both learn the basics of how the web works and to also not keep missing my buses for Sixth Form.
* Private Discord bots - some written in Java using JDA, some in JS using discord.js.
